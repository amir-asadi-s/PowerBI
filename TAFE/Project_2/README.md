# Sales Analysis Project - Power BI

## Overview
This project was completed as part of the TAFE Applied Data Analytics course. It demonstrates a comprehensive sales analysis using Power BI, covering different regions, product categories, and fiscal years. The project follows a step-by-step approach, from data preparation and modeling to advanced DAX calculations and report design, culminating in a dynamic and interactive sales dashboard.

## Labs Overview

### 01 - Prepare Data with Power Query
In this lab, we focused on connecting to various data sources, including SQL Server and CSV files. Using Power Query, we explored and profiled the data, assessing data quality and identifying potential issues. The lab introduced basic transformations to prepare the data for further analysis.

- **Skills Learned:** Data connection, data profiling, column quality checks, basic data transformation using Power Query.

### 02 - Load Data into Power BI
This lab emphasized importing data from different sources into Power BI, focusing on SQL Server and CSV files. We cleaned and transformed the data, ensuring it was ready for modeling by handling missing values and establishing key relationships between tables.

- **Skills Learned:** Data loading, data transformation, handling missing values, setting up table relationships.

### 03 - Configure Data Model in Power BI
In this lab, we established relationships between data tables using a star schema, which allowed for efficient data integration and reporting. We also created calculated columns to enhance the data model for reporting and visualization purposes.

- **Skills Learned:** Table relationships, calculated columns, star schema modeling.

### 04 - Create Basic DAX Calculations
This lab introduced DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for creating measures and calculated fields, such as Total Sales and Profit Margin. These basic calculations were essential for generating key metrics used in the reports.

- **Skills Learned:** Basic DAX, calculated columns, measures, data aggregation.

### 05 - Create Advanced DAX Calculations
Building on the basic DAX knowledge, this lab covered more complex DAX formulas, including Time Intelligence functions and filter context manipulation. These techniques enabled more sophisticated and dynamic data analysis.

- **Skills Learned:** Advanced DAX, Time Intelligence, custom DAX measures, filter context.

### 06 - Design a Basic Power BI Report
In this lab, we created a two-page report using Power BIâ€™s visualization tools. The report featured various visuals, such as bar charts, line charts, and KPIs, to showcase key insights into sales performance.

- **Skills Learned:** Report creation, visual design, using slicers for interactivity.

### 07 - Design an Enhanced Power BI Report
This lab enhanced the basic report by adding advanced features such as bookmarks, drill-through capabilities, and conditional formatting, improving both the design and functionality of the report.

- **Skills Learned:** Advanced report design, drill-through, bookmarks, conditional formatting.

### 08 - Perform Data Analysis in Power BI
In the final lab, we performed advanced data analysis, including forecasting future sales and using scatter charts to explore relationships between sales metrics. The forecasting tool allowed us to predict future trends based on historical data.

- **Skills Learned:** Forecasting, scatter charts, animated visuals, interactive reports.

## Final Visualization
The project culminated in a detailed Power BI dashboard featuring the following visualizations:

1. **Sales and Profit Margin by Month**  
   A line chart showing the sales and profit margin trends from July 2019 to June 2020.
   
2. **Sales by Country and Category**  
   A bar chart visualizing sales split by country and product category (Accessories, Bikes, Clothing, Components).

3. **Sum of Quantity by Category**  
   A bar chart displaying the total quantity sold by category, with the highest numbers in Clothing and Bikes.

4. **Sales and Target by Month**  
   A column chart comparing actual sales to sales targets on a monthly basis, showing the variance.

5. **Sales, Profit Margin, and Quantity by Business Type and Quarter**  
   A combined chart that showcases sales, profit margin, and total quantities by business type over several quarters.

6. **Sum of Sales by Date**  
   A line chart presenting the sum of sales over time from July 2018 to April 2020, showing overall sales trends.
